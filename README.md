```

## üîê Environment Variables
Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) at repo root:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-project-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
VITE_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your-flutterwave-public-key>
# Optional / roadmap
VITE_ANALYTICS_WRITE_KEY=<analytics-key>
```

Never commit secret service role keys. For secure server-side operations use Edge Functions with service role available only in that runtime.

## üöÄ Getting Started
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd MamaCare_app
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # if you create one
npm run dev
```
Visit: http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

### Type Checking & Lint
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

### Build & Preview
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## üë§ Authentication & Profiles
- User signs up (Supabase auth) ‚Üí row-level policy creates profile (migration: create_profile_on_signup)
- Profile fields: id, email, display_name, avatar_url, is_premium, lmp_date, etc.
- Premium gating: pages (e.g., Medical Centers) read `profile.is_premium`.

## üí¨ Chat Flow (Ask a Nurse)
1. User sends message ‚Üí optimistic insert to `chat_messages`
2. Edge function (AI) processes, persists AI response
3. Escalation flag triggers nurse notification (Telegram function) when confidence low or user requests human help
4. Real-time subscription updates UI instantly

## üé® Theming
Tailwind + CSS custom properties for semantic tokens (background, surface layers, accents). Dark mode tuned for legibility, bubble differentiation (user vs AI vs nurse) and reduced nighttime glare.

## üß™ Testing (Suggested Additions)
Currently minimal; recommended next steps:
- Unit: utils & context
- Integration: chat flow mock, premium gating
- Visual regression: dark mode palettes

## üó∫ Product Roadmap (High-Level)
Quarterly themes (succinct version):
- Q1: Adaptive onboarding, real-time message status, analytics dashboards, clinician trust badges
- Q2: Multilingual rollout, symptom intelligence v2 (risk tiers), subscription lifecycle polish, contextual premium teasers
- Q3: Behavioral nudges, cohort experimentation, marketplace growth & redemption codes, community reputation layer
- Q4: Regional expansion, Partner API, predictive risk scoring (explainable), outcomes dashboards

## üõ° Security & Policies
- Supabase RLS restricts profiles & chat messages to owners
- Edge functions enforce controlled AI & escalation logic
- Avatar storage bucket scoped with read/write policies

## üì¶ Tech Decisions Rationale
- Supabase for speed: auth + realtime + SQL flexibility
- shadcn-ui for consistent, accessible primitives without heavy design system overhead
- Vite for fast DX & incremental builds
- Segregated PageHeader & AppShell for unified navigation patterns

## üß† AI Prompt Recipe (Representative Samples)
Not exhaustive; these illustrate how AI assistance shaped the codebase. Adapt wording as needed ‚Äî outputs may vary.

### 1. Refactor & Consistency
"Refactor all page headers into a single reusable PageHeader component with optional back button and right-aligned action slot, then apply it across CommunityForum, ArticleLibrary, Marketplace, MedicalCenters, PremiumScreen, AskNurse, SymptomChecker."

### 2. Dark Mode Enhancement
"Redesign dark theme tokens for better depth (layered surfaces), improve chat bubble contrast (user/AI/nurse), ensure accessible color contrast ratios. Provide updated CSS variables." 

### 3. Chat Experience Upgrade
"Revamp AskNurse component for mobile: collapsible conversation list, sticky input bar, labeled bubbles for AI vs Nurse vs User, pill toggle for AI/Human mode, responsive layout."

### 4. Premium Gating
"Add premium gating to MedicalCenters page: if user not logged in show sign-in CTA, if logged in but not premium show upgrade module, otherwise show centers; update emergency number to +2349091481560."

### 5. Auth & Profile Stability
"Audit AuthContext for unnecessary re-renders and infinite loops; implement memoization and a single profile fetch with loading + error states."

### 6. Cleanup & Audit
"List unused UI component files by searching for imports (carousel, chart, menubar, navigation-menu, etc.) and prepare a safe deletion plan."

### 7. Investor Materials
"Generate a 10-slide investor-style summary for an AI + nurse maternal health platform covering problem, solution, market, model, traction, tech moat, GTM, roadmap, ask."

### 8. Roadmap Storytelling
"Rewrite roadmap to be more compelling; remove code deletion task and emphasize personalization, intelligence, monetization, scalability."

### 9. Prompt Crafting Meta
"Given the existing features, suggest higher impact next steps that strengthen retention and differentiation (analytics, personalization, predictive risk)."

### 10. README Generation
"Draft a comprehensive README including architecture, setup, environment variables, roadmap, and a section summarizing representative AI prompts used during development."

> Tip: For reproducibility, chain prompts (refactor ‚Üí test ‚Üí polish) and request diffs or focused patches to minimize unintended changes.

### üß™ Foundational Project Bootstrap Prompt (Original + Enhanced)

Below is a refined version of the early ‚Äúproject start‚Äù style prompt you can reuse or adapt. 

#### Original (User Seed)
```
Build a mobile-first responsive web app named MamaCare (React + Vite + Tailwind). Focus on MVP pregnancy support.

Tech: React, Vite, Tailwind, Supabase (auth & profiles), Groq API (symptom checker + Q&A), Flutterwave (premium), Supabase realtime (chat).

Screens:
- Auth: signup, login, forgot password.
- Dashboard: greeting ‚ÄúHi [Name], you‚Äôre [X] weeks pregnant‚Äù, weekly tracker, buttons to Symptom Checker, Ask a Nurse, Premium.
- Symptom Checker (premium): input symptoms -> Groq {symptoms, pregnancy_week} -> 3 causes + risk (low/medium/high) + disclaimer.
- Ask a Nurse: AI answers; if high-risk ask to connect to nurse; confirm -> WhatsApp/Telegram group.
- Premium: upgrade via Flutterwave -> set is_premium true.
- Profile/Settings: name, LMP, due date, subscription, avatar.
- Placeholders: Forum, Articles.
```

#### Enhanced Bootstrap Prompt (Structured - Redefined by GPT-5)
```
You are an expert full-stack assistant. Create a web-first maternal wellness MVP "MamaCare" using:
- Stack: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn-ui components.
- Backend: Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Realtime, Storage, RLS policies).
- AI: Placeholder function (Groq/OpenAI compatible) for symptom reasoning + Q&A.
- Payments: Flutterwave (upgrade flow stub + state update is_premium=true).

Data Model:
- profiles(id, email, display_name, avatar_url, lmp_date, due_date (derive), is_premium boolean)
- chat_conversations(id, user_id, mode: 'ai'|'nurse')
- chat_messages(id, conversation_id, sender_type: 'user'|'ai'|'nurse', content, created_at)
- (future) products, medical_centers

Core Features (MVP):
1. Auth (signup/login/forgot) -> create profile row on signup.
2. Dashboard: compute gestational week from LMP; show fruit / size metaphor placeholder; buttons to Symptom Checker, Ask a Nurse, Premium.
3. Symptom Checker (premium-gated): form(symptom text); call AI stub with { symptom, pregnancy_week } -> return array of 3 { possible_cause, risk_level }; always append disclaimer.
4. Ask a Nurse: chat UI (messages list + input). Start in AI mode; escalate intent triggers nurse escalation placeholder. Real-time updates via Supabase channel.
5. Premium Screen: plan description + Flutterwave checkout -> on success update profile.is_premium.
6. Profile: edit display name, LMP (recomputes due date = LMP + 280d), avatar upload (Supabase storage), premium badge if applicable.
7. Placeholder Routes: Articles, Forum, Marketplace, Medical Centers (gated / stub).

UX & Theming:
- PageHeader component with optional back button & actions.
- Dark mode with layered surfaces + distinct chat bubble colors (user/AI/nurse).
- Mobile-first navigation; preserve readable long-form content layout.

Non-Functional:
- Type-safe Supabase client.
- Basic error + loading states.
- Accessible buttons, form labels, semantic headings.

Output: Generate files, components, and minimal README stubs. Provide diff-friendly patches only.
```

#### Ultra-Condensed One-Liner
```
React+Vite maternal wellness MVP (auth, profile w/ LMP‚Üíweeks, AI symptom checker premium-gated, hybrid AI/nurse chat w/ realtime, Flutterwave upgrade, dark mode, PageHeader abstraction, Supabase schema + RLS) ‚Äî scaffold all core screens + placeholder routes.
```


## üîÑ Deployment
- Current: Vite build artifacts (static) + Supabase backend
- Option: Use edge functions for AI & notifications (already scaffolded)
- For domain: Configure via hosting provider (e.g., Vercel / Netlify) + environment variables

## ü§ù Contributions
Internal MVP stage. Open to: accessibility improvements, test coverage PRs, performance profiling, localization contributions (Q2 roadmap).
