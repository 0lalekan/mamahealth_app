-- Allows any authenticated user to view any file in the 'avatars' bucket.
-- Avatars are generally considered public within the app.

-- 2. Policy for uploading avatars
-- Allows an authenticated user to upload a file if it's in the 'avatars' bucket.
-- The check `(storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text` is a common pattern,
-- but for simplicity, we'll allow uploads and let the frontend code manage paths.
-- A more secure version would enforce the path matches the user's ID.

-- 3. Policy for updating avatars
-- Allows an authenticated user to update their own avatar.
-- The file path must be named '{user_id}.{extension}'.
